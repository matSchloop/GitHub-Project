## Array
This program depicts a worm in a forest wriggling around, leaving an infinite body behind it.  The background, props, and worm itself have a randomly genarated color palette that uses arrays to store the variables necessary to depict the RGB values for each represented color.  The movement of the worm is randomly genarated too.  An array stores a number of x-axis values the worm will change directions when crossing, each chosen randomly.
## Input
This program has a ball that moves around a canvas through the viewer's input.  The WASD keys moves it up, left, down, and right respectively.  Each input changes the x-axis or y-axis speed the ball moves, as well as the width and height of the ball.  Each of these decrease to a set number during no viewer input through a loop.  At high enough speeds, the ball leaves a trail behind itself that dissapears when the ball lowers to a certain velocity, either in the horizontal or vertical direction.
## Text and Images
This program shows a man by the name of Haus displaying himself on a television screen.  He flahses between two poses, changing the set he flashes between depending on the horizontal value of the cursor.
